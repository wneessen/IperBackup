IperBackup - a Ipernity backup script
=====================================
IperBackup gives you the possibility to completely download all documents in
you Ipernity account. You can either let IperBackup do all the work, so that
it fetches all information and downloads every single file or you let
IperBackup just create a download URL list, which you can use with your
favourite DL manager.

The usage of IperBackup is pretty simple. First you have to decide which action to use:
	
	-l, --list	to create a list with all download URL, to use in your DL manager
	or
	-d, --download	to let IperBackup download each file for your

You should also specify an output directory, so IperBackup knows where to store your
files (or the URL list). If you don't specify the output directory, IperBackup will
use /var/tmp. The parameter for this is:

	-o, --outdir

You also will need a config file, where you define some parameters, which are mandatory
to IperBackup (e. g. your API AuthToken and the API UserID). By default IperBackup will
look for the config file in /etc/IperBackup.conf. If you wanna use another file, just 
use the:

	-c, --config

parameter to tell IperBackup where to find the config file.

If you haven't specified your API UserID and AuthToken in the config file, IperBackup 
will generate and fetch both for you, so you can add it to your config file. Once both
parameters are set in your config file, IperBackup won't bother you about this anymore.

That's all. Have fun using it!
